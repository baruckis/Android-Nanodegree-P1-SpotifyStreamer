# "Spotify Preview" 
## Android-Nanodegree-SpotifyStreamer


#### Project 1: Spotify Streamer, Stage 1

In this project, you will build a music streaming application to replicate one of the most popular app experiences in the world. This app allows you to search for an artist and then lets you play a sample of that artist's top tracks on Spotify.

In this first stage of development you will build an interaction flow that allows a user to 1) Search for an artist by name and display a list of results. 2) Display the top tracks for a selected artist.

You should have the skills you need to complete this app after completing Lessons 1-3 of Developing Android Apps.


#### Project 2: Spotify Streamer, Stage 2

In the second and final stage of this project, you will complete the end-to-end music experience of the app you started in Stage 1 by adding playback controls and optimizing the entire experience to look great on a tablet.

You are expected to have passed the Spotify Streamer, Stage 1 project prior to beginning this project.

You should have the skills you need to complete this project after completing the Developing Android Apps course, focusing on Lessons 4 and 5.
