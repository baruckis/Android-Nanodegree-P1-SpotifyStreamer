# Android-Nanodegree-P1-SpotifyStreamer

Project 1: Spotify Streamer, Stage 1

In this project, you will build a music streaming application to replicate one of the most popular app experiences in the world. This app allows you to search for an artist and then lets you play a sample of that artist's top tracks on Spotify.

In this first stage of development you will build an interaction flow that allows a user to 1) Search for an artist by name and display a list of results. 2) Display the top tracks for a selected artist.
